This repository contains a very small Three.js example demonstrating basic first-person movement on a flat plane.

Open `index.html` in a browser to try the demo. Click to lock the pointer, then use **WASD** or the arrow keys to move, and move the mouse to look around.

The code is inlined in the HTML for simplicity.
